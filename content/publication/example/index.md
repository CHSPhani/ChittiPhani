abstract: Blockchains are gaining substantial recognition as an alternative to
  the traditional data storage systems due to their tampering-resistant and
  decentralized storage, independence from any centralized authority, and low
  entry barriers for new network participants. Presently blockchains allow users
  to store transactions and data sets, however, they don’t provide an easy way
  of creating and keeping relationships between data entities. In this paper, we
  demonstrate a solution that helps software developers maintain relationships
  between inter-related data entities and datasets in a blockchain. Our solution
  runs over Ethereum’s Go implementation. This is the first step towards a
  database management-like middleware system for blockchains.
