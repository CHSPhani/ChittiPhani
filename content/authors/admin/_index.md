**I happened to observe consistent changes in solution approaches to problems in different domains. Object oriented approach of providing solutions in synthesis with relational database systems were evolving when I finished my masted and started my career in 2000-01. Sooner the OO approach turned into Component oriented designs and Distribution component approach, while databases used are still realtional. Typically components are placed in middle layer where the front end contains user interface components and data access layer as the last layer. Later components became services that could be hosted in designated servers and can be discoverable using protocols such as http , tcp etc. This approach created problems of scalability which paved way for cloud based infrastructure which provides elastic way of hosting services that could be discoverable mostly using http. Then almost immediately the concept of micro-services in combination with container infrastructure ( mostly provided by Docker) again influenced design approaches of all systems. A parallel phonemina of NoSql data models araised when problems in relational database systems are identified and also other non-conventional data sources are considered for providing better functionality. As a result distributed file systems such as Hdfs and data processing platforms such as Hadoop are created, while social media giants such as google and Facebook came up with nee ways of organising data using platforms such as bigtable.**
